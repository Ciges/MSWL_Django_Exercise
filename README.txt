Django exercise for the Vth edition (2011-2012) of the Master on Free Software Projects Development and Management of Igalia and Rey Juan Carlos University from Madrid

Places Project: A list of cool places like bars, restaurants, etc.

A Place has:

    name
    description
    URL
    creation date
    number of views

The project should allow to:

    list the places by: 1) descending date; 2) number of views
    view a place (viewing a place increments its number of views)

Places should be added/edited through Django's automatic admin.

Extra points: Present a form to upload places (outside of Django's admin).
